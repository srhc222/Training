<p>Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer
  of high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in 1909
  in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born
  industrial designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their
  design beauty and for their many race victories. Famous Bugatti
  automobiles include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale",
  the Type 57 "Atlantic" and the Type 55 sports car.
  The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be a severe blow for
  the marque, and the death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 meant
  that there was no successor to lead the factory. No more than about
  8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and it
  released one last model in the 1950s before eventually being
  purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963.
  In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand name and revived
  it as Bugatti Automobili SpA.</p>
